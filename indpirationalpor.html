                <p>
                    <mark> My journey has not always been easy, but it has always been meaningful. Along the way, I
                        learned
                        that
                        being the Light of the World does not mean being perfect it means choosing to shine even in
                        moments
                        of
                        darkness. This
                        belief has shaped who I am today and continues to guide my purpose in life.</mark>
                </p>

                <p><mark> There were times when I felt lost, overwhelmed, and uncertain about my direction. I faced
                        challenges
                        that tested my
                        strength, faith, and patience. However, instead of allowing these struggles to break me, I used
                        them
                        as
                        opportunities to
                        grow. Each difficulty taught me resilience, humility, and compassion for others who are also
                        fighting
                        silent battles.</mark>
                </p>

                <p> <mark>Being the Light of the World means reflecting hope, kindness, and love through my actions. I
                        strive
                        to
                        be someone who
                        uplifts others, listens without judgment, and leads with empathy. Whether in small acts of
                        service
                        or
                        simple words of
                        encouragement, I believe that even the smallest light can make a difference in someones
                        life.</mark>
                </p>

                <p><mark> My purpose is to inspire others by living with integrity, faith, and determination. I want my
                        journey to
                        remind people
                        that their struggles do not define their response to those struggles does. By staying true
                        to
                        my
                        values and trusting Gods plan, I continue to walk forward with courage and hope.</mark>
                </p>
                <p><mark>Today, I embrace my role as a light not just for myself, but for those around me. My journey is
                        a
                        testimony that no
                        matter how dark the path may seem, light will always find a way to shine.
