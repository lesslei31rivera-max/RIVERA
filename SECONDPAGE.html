    Title: Una ang Ginoo: Living with Faith and Integrity

    This page reflects my personal belief that God should always come first in everything I do, including my actions
    online.
    Being a “Light of the World” means showing kindness, honesty, and respect, especially in digital spaces where words
    and
    actions can easily hurt others. I practice responsible digital citizenship by thinking before I post, respecting
    different opinions, and using technology in a positive way. My faith guides me to choose what is right even when no
    one
    is watching.
