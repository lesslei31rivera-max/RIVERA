    Title: Using Technology to Spread God’s Light

    This page shows how technology can be used as a tool to spread positivity and faith. Examples include sharing
    inspirational Bible verses, creating faith-based content, and using social media to encourage others. When used
    responsibly, technology becomes a powerful way to share hope, love, and spiritual messages, helping us fulfill our
    role
    as the “Light of the World” in the digital age.
