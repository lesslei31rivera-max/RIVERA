                <p>
                    “Una ang Ginoo” is more than just a phrase for me, it is a guiding principle that shapes how I live
                    my
                    life. Putting God
                    first means trusting Him in every decision I make, especially during moments of uncertainty,
                    struggle,
                    and doubt. There
                    are times when life feels overwhelming, but remembering to place God at the center gives me strength
                    and
                    peace.
                </p>

                <p>Living with faith teaches me to believe even when I cannot see the outcome. It reminds me that Gods
                    plans are always
                    greater than mine, and that patience and prayer are important in facing lifes challenges. When I
                    choose
                    to rely on God,
                    I find comfort in knowing that I am never alone, no matter how difficult the situation is.
                </p>

                <p> Integrity, for me it is my faith is reflected in my actions. It pushes me to do what is right even
                    when
                    it
                    is not easy or when no one is watching. My faith calls me to be honest, responsible, and
                    compassionate
                    toward others. By
                    living with integrity, I show respect not only to myself but also to God and the people around me.
                </p>

                <p>Through this reflection, I realize that putting God first allows me to grow spiritually and
                    personally.
                    “Una ang Ginoo”
                    reminds me to walk with humility, faith, and sincerity. It inspires me to live a life that honors
                    God
                    through my words,
                    actions, and choices every day.
